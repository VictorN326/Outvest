It might take time to load for some things as well because the backend is deployed through render.com as a free option. The RAM speed is 512 mb of free and cpu is .5 as well.
There are some "gimmick" buttons/functionality for now as well such as the static value charts,
message, reviews, calls, and very few more but will update the application as time goes on to have every single
component functional. It is still a CRUD application that is supported by the backend with , MongoDB/mongoose.
